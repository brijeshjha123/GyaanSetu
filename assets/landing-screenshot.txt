PLACEHOLDER for landing screenshot

To display the screenshot in this repository's README, place the actual image file at:

  assets/landing-screenshot.png

You can do this by saving the screenshot image (PNG) with that filename. Once the PNG is present, GitHub and other renderers will display it in the README.

If you'd like, I can try to add the provided attachment into this path — tell me to proceed and I'll attempt to place the image file as `assets/landing-screenshot.png`.
